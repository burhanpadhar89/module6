q1.Introduction to conditional statements: if, else, elif.

🧱 1. What Are Conditional Statements?

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

Syntax in Python:

if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # code to execute if the first condition is False but another_condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if all above conditions are False


Conditions usually involve comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) or logical operators (and, or, not).

⚙️ 2. Practical Example — Using if, elif, and else
"""
Program: Demonstrate conditional statements in Python
Author: ChatGPT (Example)
Description:
    This program asks the user for their age and gives feedback
    using if, elif, and else statements.
"""

# Take input from the user
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Conditional statements
if age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif 13 <= age < 20:
    print("You are a teenager.")
elif 20 <= age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior.")

🧩 3. Sample Output
Enter your age: 10
You are a child.

Enter your age: 16
You are a teenager.

Enter your age: 35
You are an adult.

Enter your age: 70
You are a senior.

🧠 4. Key Points

if: Checks a condition first; executes block if True.

elif (else if): Checks another condition if the previous if was False.

else: Executes when all previous conditions are False.

Indentation matters: Python uses indentation to define blocks. Forgetting it causes errors.

Comparison and logical operators are often used in conditions.

# Example with logical operators
x = 10
if x > 5 and x < 15:
    print("x is between 5 and 15")

Nested if-else Conditions in Python
1. Definition

A nested if-else condition occurs when an if or else statement is placed inside another if or else block. It allows you to check multiple levels of conditions, enabling more complex decision-making in your programs.

Structure:



2. Key features:

Multiple Decision Levels: Nested if-else allows checking conditions inside other conditions.

Indentation Matters: Each nested block must be indented properly; otherwise, Python will raise an error.

Combination with elif: You can use elif statements inside nested conditions for more clarity.

Complex Logic Handling: Helps when a single condition check is not enough to determine the outcome.


Explanation:

First, the program checks if the score is 50 or more.

If True, it enters the nested block to check for specific grades.

If False, it executes the else block and declares a failing grade.

3. Advantages

Makes code capable of handling complex decision scenarios.

Allows step-by-step evaluation of conditions.

Useful for grading systems, eligibility checks, menu-driven programs, and more.

4. Things to Keep in Mind

Avoid too many nested levels; it can make code hard to read.

You can simplify deeply nested conditions using logical operators (and, or) or by using functions.
