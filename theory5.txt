q1. Introduction to for andwhile loops
🔁 What Is a Loop?

A loop is a structure that lets a program repeat a set of instructions multiple times, either for a fixed number of times or until a certain condition is met.

🔹 The for Loop
➤ Purpose:

A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat something — for example, iterating over a list, a range of numbers, or a sequence.

➤ Syntax (Python Example):
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute repeatedly

➤ Example 1: Counting from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)


Output:

1
2
3
4
5


Here:

i takes each value from 1 to 5.

The loop runs 5 times.

➤ Example 2: Looping through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

🔹 The while Loop
➤ Purpose:

A while loop is used when you don’t know in advance how many times you’ll need to loop — it continues as long as a condition remains true.

➤ Syntax:
while condition:
    # Code to execute repeatedly

➤ Example 1: Counting until a condition is false
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1


Output:

1
2
3
4
5


Here:

The loop keeps running while count <= 5.

Once count becomes 6, the condition is false, and the loop stops.

🔸 Key Differences Between for and while
Feature	for loop	while loop
Use case	When the number of iterations is known	When the number of iterations is unknown
Structure	Iterates over a sequence (range, list, etc.)	Runs as long as a condition is True
Common pitfall	—	Risk of infinite loops if the condition never becomes False
🧠 Example Comparison
# Using for loop
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")

# Using while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Hello")
    count += 1


Both print "Hello" 5 times — but they use different logic to do so.

q2. HowloopsworkinPython.

🔁 What Is a Loop?

A loop lets your Python program repeat a block of code multiple times, either:

For a fixed number of times, or

Until a certain condition is met.

Python has two main types of loops:

for loop

while loop

🔹 1. for Loop — Iteration Over a Sequence
➤ How It Works:

A for loop in Python iterates (goes through) each element in a sequence — such as a list, tuple, string, or range() of numbers.

➤ Syntax:
for variable in sequence:
    # Code block to run for each item

➤ Step-by-Step Example:
for num in range(1, 4):
    print("Number:", num)


How Python executes this:

range(1, 4) generates the numbers 1, 2, 3.

Python sets num = 1 and runs the code inside the loop.

Then num = 2, runs the code again.

Then num = 3, runs it again.

When the sequence is over, the loop stops automatically.

Output:

Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3

➤ Looping Through a List:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


Output:

apple
banana
cherry

🔹 2. while Loop — Repetition Based on a Condition
➤ How It Works:

A while loop keeps running as long as its condition is True.
When the condition becomes False, Python stops the loop.

➤ Syntax:
while condition:
    # Code block to repeat

➤ Step-by-Step Example:
count = 1
while count <= 3:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1


How Python executes this:

Checks if count <= 3. (At first, count = 1, so True)

Runs the loop body → prints Count is: 1.

Increases count to 2 → condition still True.

Runs again → prints Count is: 2.

Increases count to 3 → still True.

Prints Count is: 3.

Increases count to 4 → condition now False → loop stops.

Output:

Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3

⚠️ Important Concepts
🔸 Infinite Loops

If a while loop’s condition never becomes False, the loop will never stop.

while True:
    print("This runs forever!")  # ⚠️ Infinite loop


You can stop it manually by pressing Ctrl + C.

🔸 break Statement

Used to exit a loop early.

for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)


Output: 0 1 2 3 4

🔸 continue Statement

Skips the rest of the loop body and goes to the next iteration.

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)


Output: 0 1 3 4 (2 is skipped)

🔸 else with Loops

In Python, you can even add an else clause to a loop — it runs only if the loop wasn’t stopped with break.

for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished!")


Output:

0
1
2
Loop finished!

🧠 Summary

Stops When	Sequence is exhausted	Condition becomes false
Best for	Known number of iterations	Unknown number of iterations

q3. Usingloopswithcollections (lists, tuples, etc.).
🔹 What Are Collections?

Collections are data structures that store multiple items together.
In Python, the most common ones are:

Collection Type	Example	Description
List	[1, 2, 3]	Ordered, changeable (mutable)
Tuple	(1, 2, 3)	Ordered, unchangeable (immutable)
Set	{1, 2, 3}	Unordered, no duplicates
Dictionary	{'a': 1, 'b': 2}	Key–value pairs
🔁 Why Use Loops with Collections?

Loops allow you to go through each element in a collection one by one, so you can:

Access or process each item

Perform calculations

Modify elements (for lists)

Search for specific values

🔸 Using for Loops with Collections

The for loop is the most common way to iterate through collections in Python.

🧩 Example 1: Looping Through a List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


Output:

apple
banana
cherry


👉 Each item in the list is assigned to fruit in turn.

🧩 Example 2: Looping Through a Tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

for color in colors:
    print(color)


Output:

red
green
blue


Tuples work just like lists in loops — the only difference is that you can’t modify them.

🧩 Example 3: Looping Through a Set
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}

for n in numbers:
    print(n)


Output (order may vary):

1
2
3
4


👉 Sets are unordered, so the items might appear in a different order each time.

🧩 Example 4: Looping Through a Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

# Loop through keys
for key in student:
    print(key)


Output:

name
age
grade


You can also loop through values or key–value pairs:

# Loop through values
for value in student.values():
    print(value)

# Loop through key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, ":", value)


Output:

name : Alice
age : 20
grade : A

🔸 Using while Loops with Collections

A while loop doesn’t automatically go through a collection —
you usually use an index to access items.

🧩 Example:
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
i = 0

while i < len(numbers):
    print(numbers[i])
    i += 1


Output:

10
20
30
40


Here:

len(numbers) gives the number of items.

We manually increase i each time to move through the list.

🔸 Bonus: Nested Loops with Collections

You can even use loops inside other loops to work with multi-dimensional data (like lists of lists).

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        print(item, end=" ")
    print()


Output:

1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9

🧠 Summary
Collection	Loop Example	Notes
List	for item in list:	Ordered, changeable
Tuple	for item in tuple:	Ordered, unchangeable
Set	for item in set:	Unordered, no duplicates
Dictionary	for key, value in dict.items():	Key–value pairs
While Loop	Use while with an index	Manual control of iteration
