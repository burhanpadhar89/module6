q1.Understandingthe role of break, continue, and pass in Python loops.
🔁 Control Statements in Python Loops

Python provides three special statements that control the flow inside for and while loops:

✅ 1. break — Exit the loop immediately

break stops the loop entirely, no matter whether the condition is still true or items are left to iterate.

Example:
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)


Output:

1
2
3
4


The loop stops when i becomes 5.

🔄 2. continue — Skip to the next iteration

continue tells Python to skip the rest of the loop body and jump to the next iteration.

Example:
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)


Output:

1
2
4
5


The number 3 is skipped.

🟦 3. pass — Do nothing (placeholder)

pass literally does nothing. It's often used when a statement is required syntactically but you don’t want to execute anything yet.

Example:
for i in range(1, 4):
    if i == 2:
        pass  # placeholder
    print(i)


Output:

1
2
3


Here, pass just makes the interpreter happy while you plan to write code later.
